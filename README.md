# SSDtools

DIT IS EEN TESTWIJZIGING
A Python toolbox that contains common objects and functions used for reporting on the environmental impact of air traffic movements on airports surrounding. It's consist of two main functionalities:
- Datafiles containing air traffic schedules can be loaded and analysis can be performed.
- Noise grids can be loaded and Lden and Lnight levels at individual locations can be computed. Used for official reporting about noise impact at Schiphol airport. 

## Creating conda environment with ssdtools installed (for Schiphol users)
If you are using the conda editor, here is some useful code to get you started by setting up an environment this packages has been tested in. First make a environment.yml file, from which to set up your conda environment, containing the following code:
```yaml
name: ssd
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python=3.6
  - numpy=1.16.*
  - pandas=0.24.*
  - scipy=1.2.*
  - xlrd=1.2.*
  - requests=2.21.*
  - matplotlib=3.0.*
  - gdal=2.3.*
  - proj4=5.*
  - pyshp=2.1.*
  - pytables=3.5.*
  - geopandas=0.4.*
  - descartes=1.1.*
  - pytest=4.4.*
  - nose=1.3.*
  - pillow=6.0.*
  - pip=19.1.*
  - python-docx=0.8.*
  - spyder=3.*
  - imageio=2.6.*

```
Create environment using the following command in a conda command prompt.
```conda prompt
# to install from environment.yml, use:
conda env create -f environment.yml

```
Now install SSDTools. Open a git bash, and type the following command.Make sure you have a personal access token, to circumvent the two-factor identification. For more info on a personal acces token, see: https://github.com/settings/tokens 

```git bash
conda init bash
conda activate ssd
pip install git+https://git@github.com/Schiphol-Hub/SSDTools.git@master#egg=SSDTools

```
When prompted for a password, use the personal acces token. Now reinstall the spyder kernels:

```conda prompt
conda activate ssd
conda install spyder-kernels=0.*
```

Note: when importing SSD tools, make sure spyder is pointing to the correct python.exe. Go to tools->preferences-> python interpreter and set the interpreter to your environment path, e.g.:
C:\Users\dalmeijer_w\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\envs\ssd\python.exe

## Installation (for non-schiphol users)

If you want to use this package in your own project, you can import this package by running the following command or include it in the `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` of your project.

```bash
# Execute the the following command in your terminal to install the latest version of SSDtools. 

# If you work with an ssh key, then use:
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/Schiphol-Hub/SSDTools@master#egg=SSDTools

# OR clone first using for example https:
git clone https://github.com/Schiphol-Hub/SSDTools.git

# and then install to environement from local repo:
pip install git+file:///PATH_TO_CLONE#egg=SSDTools

# OR install directly using hhtps:
pip install git+https://github.com/Schiphol-Hub/SSDTools.git@master#egg=SSDTools

```

## Recommendations for further development

1. Separate `MultiGrid` from `Grid`
1. Create `Scenario` object which contains both _Lden_ and _Lnight_ grids
1. Add `imshow()` as alternative to `contourf()`
1. Make `Traffic` compatible with `Schedule` from TAFTools
1. Create standardized/preferred data types for each object
1. Organise a git training for all future contributors
1. Separate the verification cases from the unit tests
1. Remove the data from the repository
1. Use map service instead of manually provided background image.

### Add `imshow()` as alternative to `contourf()`
The package now uses vectors to ensure high quality of images, however, for some use cases it might be sufficient to use a pixel-perfect method such as `imshow()`. Supporting both types in heatmaps will result in the possibility to choose between runtime performance and precision. This means faster rendering times during development and high quality images for publication. 

### Remove the data from the repository
The package currently includes a number of large files, including WBS files (_woningbestanden_). It is a good idea to store these large data files on a different location (i.e. not in this repository). Furthermore, it might be a good idea to publish this data and make it available to the public, such that other users of this package can also access this data on request.
